  	<h1 style="text-align: center;">Ode to a Well-meaning Friend</h1>
  	<br>
  	<p>And in that crisp voice, he says

to write of daisies in summer –

as if they themselves were idle men

with undirected intellect,

waving in the winds of neglect,

and feeding on the rains of last month.

Oh, that I too, could have such vigor.



And in that crisp voice, he says

to write of wonder, hope and awe –

as if they were birds of prey,

flapping their mighty wings above

the little fields of daisies

without a thought, without a pause.

Oh, that I too could have such vigor.



But alas, I cannot dip my feather pen

in antiquated ink, nor sip that aged 

and vile drink, like antiquated men –

like the Romance of a simpler age,

that vigor has all but left my ways.

And in that crisp voice, he says,

to write about the daisies in summer…</p>
